### [About Black Girls CODE](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/about-us/)

We build pathways for young women of color to embrace the current tech marketplace as builders and creators by introducing them to skills in computer programming and technology.

Radical action is needed if we are to close the opportunity gap for Black women and girls. We lead a global movement to establish equal representation in the tech sector. Black Girls CODE is devoted to showing the world that Black girls can code and do so much more. Together, we are creating stronger economies and more equitable societies—ultimately realizing the true potential of democracy through diversity and inclusion.
